# SkinAI
# Skin Disease Prediction using CNN:
This project is a machine learning model that can predict different types of skin diseases by looking at images. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) â€” a special kind of deep learning model used in image classification.

#Model Overview
I have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to build the model.

The model has several layers:

Convolution layers to detect features.

MaxPooling layers to reduce size.

Dropout layers to avoid overfitting.

Dense (Fully Connected) layers for prediction.

#Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib

NumPy

#Model Training
The model was trained for 10 epochs.

Training and validation accuracy/loss is printed during each epoch.

#Saving the Model
After training, the model is saved as a .h5 file so it can be used later without retraining.
